## Environment variables

Environment variables are used for sensitive data that should not be exposed
in the public Git repository. They need to be configured to run and test this application. The following is a comprehensive list of all
environment variables that are necessary for proper program execution:

- `JDBC_URL`: the database url
- `JDBC_USERNAME`: the database username
- `JDBC_PASSWORD`: the database password
- `MAPS_API_KEY`: the Google Maps API key

### Setting up environment variables in STS:

- In the run dropdown menu, select run configurations
